## About The Project

I create a Frontend E-Commerce application using the PokéAPI. The following tasks were implemented successfully:

- Product catalog
- Side cart
- Cart Summary
- 3 stores with different styles and types of Pokémon (water, grass and fire)
- Search bar to filter Pokemon
- Checkout button, restarting the checkout process
- Thank you modal when finalizing the purchase
- Save user purchase data locally so you don't lose it when refreshing the page (local storage)
- Tests using React Testing Library and Jest
- Responsive design (starting from 320px and up)

### Built With:

- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.
- [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.
